INSTALLATION:

     From sources (probably requires developer's tools to be installed):
         First, make sure py-appscript is installed http://appscript.sourceforge.net/
	 Type "make real" in from the PyeTV directory.
	 sudo mv dist/EyeTV.frappliance /System/Library/CoreServices/Front\ Row.app/Contents/PlugIns/


     Binary: move dist/EyeTV.frappliance to /System/Library/CoreServices/Front\ Row.app/Contents/PlugIns/
	If you do this from the Finder, you will need to use an
	option-click on Front Row.app and choose "Show package
	contents" to see the Contents directory.


     NOTE: In both cases you will need to restart Front Row before the plugin will show up.  

           bash$  sudo killall Front\ Row

     EyeTV should be running *before* invoking Front Row.


DEVELOPERS:
     
    Instead of typing "make real", you may wish to type "make link".
    ln -sf /path/to/PyeTV/dist/EyeTV.frappliance /System/Library/CoreServices/Front\ Row.app/Contents/PlugIns/
     

OUTSTANDING ISSUES:

     After pausing a recording in EyeTV, and returning to Front Row,
     we do not return to the same place in the menu hierarchy.

     The item count in the menu items is not properly updated after
     deleting an item.

     There is no photo preview.

     EyeTV must be running before Front Row or the list of recordings
     takes too long to acquire, the EyeTV recordings menu is empty.

     We have to expose the desktop (hide Front Row) *before* we can
     tell EyeTV to go full screen, so the transition between FR and
     EyeTV is somewhat ugly.

     Not (yet) integrated with etv-comskip:
        http://code.google.com/p/etv-comskip/

     The timeouts (amount of time we have to wait before sendig
     certain events to EyeTV) could use some more tuning.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

	This work was made possible by the FrontPython project, and
        would literally not have been possible without it.

        Special thanks to garionPHX of that project for all his
        assistance.


	FrontPython, in turn, made use of techniques developed by the
	fine folks at the Sapphire project: http://appletv.nanopi.net/.
